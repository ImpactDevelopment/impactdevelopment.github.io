## 4.5

### Added
- Added a GUI to manage and create [Macros](https://github.com/ImpactDevelopment/ImpactClient/issues/153). A macros system was added in 4.3, but they could only be managed by manually editing the json file.

  - This means that there should be no conflicts with using Freecam with everything, your "real player" will behave as expected when you're not using Freecam in all circumstances
    - Aka, you can path using Baritone AND use Freecam simultaneously, it's really neat
